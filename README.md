# angular-contact-manager-app
Full stack single page application for contact management!
# Angular + Node Contact Manager

## Angular API Communication and Authentication

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2.



## Build tasks

  * `npm start`: this will run a production build of the Angular app, and place the bundles in `server/public` directory, and then will start the Node + Express app. This is typically what you would want to do if deploying the applicaiton.
  * `npm run watch`: this will utilize webpack-dev-server to run the Angular app in a live development server, watching for any changes, and also start the Express app at port 3000. Since the app is running on port 4200, we supply a proxy config file to proxy all requests to `/api` to `localhost:3000/api`.

  * Making changes to the code will live reload both the client and the server.

  ## For development

  * `npm run sample`: this will seed THE database with initial contacts and users.
